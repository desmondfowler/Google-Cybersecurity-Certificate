## Draft

As an analyst with foundational expertise in computer science and data analysis, I am passionately pivoting toward the dynamic field of cybersecurity. My conviction aligns with the pioneering spirit of organizations like the EFF, advocating for radical transparency, robust data protection, and the defense of digital rights, all while adhering to rigorous security frameworks such as NIST and GDPR.

My tenure at Arkansas State University, though not explicitly in cybersecurity, demanded a disciplined approach to data protection protocols, particularly with SPII and PII. This sharpened my ability to recognize potential internal threats and maintain rigorous data security, laying a solid foundation for navigating and mitigating the complex cyber risks in today's organizational environments.

I am enhancing my theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience in tools like SIEMs, network analyzers, and Python scripting. These practical skills, coupled with the pursuit of a Google Cybersecurity Certificate and the CompTIA Security+ certification, mark a strategic progression toward the complexities of cyber defense. My aim is to delve into red-team scenarios, employing creative and ethical hacking skills for the greater good.

I'm drawn to red-team operations because of their crucial role in simulating real-world cyberattacks, enabling organizations to proactively strengthen their defenses. This role suits my analytical and investigative prowess and aligns with my ethical commitment to digital security, reflecting my lifelong pursuit of continuous learning and professional growth.

With an array of experiences beyond the conventional cybersecurity path, I bring a distinctive perspective that fuels unconventional thinking, unlocking new avenues of defense. These insights are poised to significantly impact the cybersecurity landscape.

Dedicated to integrating my skills with the strategic security goals of future employers, my goal is to not only enhance cyber resilience but also provide a strategic advantage, empowering organizations to confidently navigate and stay ahead in the ever-evolving cyber threatscape.
