Hackers are people who exploit vulnerabilities to gain access or control to a system or network. Depending on the situation, this access may be authorized and ethical, or unauthorized and unethical.

## Types

There are different types of hackers, usually described by their different colored "hats." The colors (and a brief description) are as follows:

- White Hat
	- Generally known as ethical hackers, white hats follow a code of ethics, adhere to the law, and generally work for organizations that conduct risk assessments and evaluations. They want to safeguard people and organizations from malicious threat actors by using an "offensive" defense strategy.
- Black Hat
	- The complete opposite of White Hat hackers, Black Hat hackers are unethical, malicious threat actors who do not follow or respect the law. Their goals can be many, but usually it is to sell confidential data for financial gain.
- Grey Hat
	- Grey Hat hackers straddle the line, but are not on either end of the spectrum of White - Black. They may sometimes violate laws or typical ethical standards, but they generally do not have malicious intent. 
- Red Hat
	- Red Hat hackers act sort of like a vigilante in the hacker world, attempting to protect people and organizations from Black Hats by going after them directly. This may be illegal, or unethical, but they take aggressive steps to stop Black Hats. 
- Blue Hat
	- This hat is vague in its definition, and generally has two main ideas. They are known as either revenge seekers or outside security professionals. This info is sourced from [here](https://sectigostore.com/blog/different-types-of-hackers-hats-explained/).
- Green Hat
	- Green Hat hackers are new hackers, generally keen learners and determined. Their inexperience may cause them to inadvertently cause harm but they rarely intend for that outcome.
