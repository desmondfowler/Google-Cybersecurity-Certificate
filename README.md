# google-cybersecurity-certificate

A repository to store all my work, notes, and projects from the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program.

I am using Obsidian MD for a lot of my notetaking. All the markdown files it uses are housed in the Google-Cybersecurity-Certificate-Obsidian-Vault subfolder.
